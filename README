# Overview

The nova-compute-power charm deploys openstack to a given Power8 compute node. 

# Usage

To deploy a nova-compute-power service you have to have the following:

* Generate a ssh key that the charm can use to login to the compute node
  to start installing RPMS and configuration file
* A yum repoistiory which contains the apprioate IBM Openstack Icehouse 
  RPMs.
* Sudo password-les configured for the user on the compute node.

Once you have this setup you must configure the charm as follow:

1. Place the key to the nova-compute node in the files directory of the
   charm.
2. Create a config.yaml that has the following:

	* power-user: username used to access and configure the power node.
    * power-repo: Yum repository url.
    * power-hosts: IP address of power node
